[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/cache-buster.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/cache-buster)

`cache-buster` helps busting stale cache for static websites.
For instance, let's suppose you have the following structure, maybe generated by some other tool such as Jekyll:

```
.
├── assets
│   ├── scripts
│   │   └── main.js
│   └── style
│       └── main.css
└── index.html
```

And your index page is as beautiful as

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style/main.css">
    <script src="http://google.com/foo/bar"></script>
    <script src="https://my.website/assets/scripts/main.js"></script>
    <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello, this is my gorgeous website.
</body>
</html>
```

`cache-buster` can update your HTML to update all assets with an hash of its contents:

```
$ cache-buster --assets assets --base-url https://my.website
```

Which will update your website to the following structure:

```
.
├── assets
│   ├── scripts
│   │   └── main_88782689275158862f158fb9030e2a2599bd82bb.js
│   └── style
│       └── main_1ae3e9bf3a50ebd227b33460915a7672e1f94382.css
└── index.html
```

and also update all your HTML files to point to the correct hashed files:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style/main_1ae3e9bf3a50ebd227b33460915a7672e1f94382.css">
    <script src="http://google.com/foo/bar"></script>
    <script src="https://my.website/assets/scripts/main_88782689275158862f158fb9030e2a2599bd82bb.js"></script>
    <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello, this is my gorgeous website.
</body>
</html>

```
